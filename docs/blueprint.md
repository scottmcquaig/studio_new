## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: #2C3E50 to provide a sense of groundedness and seriousness, suitable for the stoic philosophy.
- Background color: #ECF0F1 (light gray) to provide a clean and neutral backdrop, ensuring readability and focus.
- Accent color: #3498DB (a shade of blue) to highlight interactive elements and key actions, providing a subtle contrast and guiding user attention.
- Headline font: A bold, masculine sans-serif such as 'Roboto' or 'Inter', to convey strength and clarity.
- Body font: A clear, readable sans-serif such as 'Roboto' or 'Open Sans', optimized for body text to ensure comfort during long reading sessions.
- Use simple line icons that fit a clean, minimal style. The flame icon for streaks should be distinct and easily recognizable and consider using icons from a consistent set like 'Feather' or 'Simple Line Icons'.
- Design a mobile-first responsive layout that adapts well to different screen sizes. Focus on a single-column layout for mobile and consider multi-panel layouts for larger screens, ensuring key content is always accessible and easy to interact with.
- Incorporate subtle animations for completing daily challenges and streak tracking, adding a satisfying and engaging element. Use CSS transitions and animations sparingly to maintain a minimalist feel.
